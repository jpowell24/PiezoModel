Please read the .tex files in order to learn about the theory of the model. 

History of production: apapangelapeng/Neuron-Model

Computation is done by .cpp files, and graphed in Jupyter Notebook. 

# A brief overview: 
The most important file is currently titled `2d_Calcium_DynamicsV5.cpp`, and you will  find other files with earlier versions. It is not usful to look at the earlier versions, unless you are curious about earlier mistakes. `.cpp` files are graphed in `.ipynb` files of the same name (generally, that is). `2d_Calcium_DynamicsV5.cpp` is a combination of nearly all of the other files, as they were built independently and then combined into this file to make a cohesive model. The header file, `2d_Calcium_Dynamics.h` contains some of the needed packages and variables. Of extreme note is that the linear algebra package, Eigen, is used to perform matrix operations in this code. One will need to download Eigen for this code to run.
